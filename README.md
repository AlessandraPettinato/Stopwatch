A simple Stopwatch made with HTML & CSS.
JavaScript was used to manipulate the DOM and make the interaction with the app possible.

Whit this Stopwatch can start the counter, stop it, set laps and reset it.
At every lap, the stopwatch records either the total time and the difference between it and the moment we set the lap.
