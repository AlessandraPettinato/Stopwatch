A simple Stopwatch made with HTML & CSS.
JavaScript was used to manipulate the DOM and make the interaction with the app possible.

This Stopwatch is able to start a counter, stop it, set laps and reset it.
At every lap, the stopwatch records either the total time and the difference between it and the moment the lap is set.
